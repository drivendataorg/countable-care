# Countable Care: Modeling Women's Care Decisions

This git hub repo hosts the winning submissions for Countable Care: Modeling Women's Care Decisions, a DrivenData competition.

Gilberto Titericz won the competition using an ensemble method.  Gilberto explains his reasoning:
>As the predictive power of the dataset comes mainly from the categorical features and features donâ€™t have many levels, I decided to quit using a simple feature selection and use the ensemble technique to better explore feature interaction between all features and different learning techniques.
